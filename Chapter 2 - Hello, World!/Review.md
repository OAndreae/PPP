Chapter 2 Review
================

1.  The purpose of the “Hello, World!” program is to introduce the key concepts
    of a new programming language (the tool) to any new programmer. This
    includes using an IDE, compiling, linking, and running the program.

2.  There are four parts to a function: the return type (e.g. *int*); the
    function name (e.g. *main()*); the parameters (e.g. **int argc**); and the
    body (e.g. **{cout \<\< “Hello, World!\\n”;}**)**.**

3.  The **main()** function must appear in every C++ program.

4.  The purpose of the **return 0** statement is to indicate to the system that
    the program exited without failure.

5.  The purpose of the compiler is to take the human-readable *source code* and
    ‘translate’ it to machine readable *machine code.*

6.  The purpose of the **\#include** directive is to ‘include’ another source
    code file (a header file).

7.  The **.h** file suffix at the end of a file name in C++ signifies that the
    file is a *header* file.

8.  The linker takes the files of object code created by the compiler and
    ‘links’ them together into an executable program.

9.  The difference between a source code file and an object code file is: a
    source code file is human-readable, whereas an object file is
    machine-readable.

10. An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a graphical software program
    that makes it easier to write, compile, link, and debug programs.

11. It is necessary to practice programming as programming is a practical
    activity and one can only improve from experience.
